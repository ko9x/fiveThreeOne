            <p>The 5/3/1 program recommends regular TM Testing to ensure your TM is not too high.</p>
            <p>If your TM is determined to be too high, then you will want to deload.</p>
            <p>For the TM test week you will still be lifting 3 days a week but the workouts are as follows.</p>

                    <ion-col col-4 >{{set.weight}}</ion-col>

            <p>Moday is Squats, Wednesday is Shoulder Press followed by Dead Lifts, and Friday is Bench press.</p>
            <p>If your TM is correct you should be able to do 3-5 reps at 100%. If you are able to hit 3-5 then move on to the next cycle and add 5 pounds to upper body workouts and 10 to lower body workouts.</p>
            <p>If you were unable to hit 3-5 reps at 100% you may want to deload and get your TM dialed in.</p>
            <p>Don't be discouraged if you are unable to hit 3-5 reps. Deloading is a normal part of the 5/3/1 process.</p>
