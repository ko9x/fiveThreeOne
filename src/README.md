# Things to remember
* Make a Commit after every step! 

# What to do next
* finish implementing the weight select portion
    * I want the buttons to become disabled once the weight has been stored
    * hitting the clear button will clear the stored weights and activate the buttons

#Done
* figure out how to dispaly the locally stored One Rep Max values
    * I made an array of objects with the properties I needed nested inside the objects
