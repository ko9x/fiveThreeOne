#Done
* figure out how to dispaly the locally stored One Rep Max values
    * I made an array of objects with the properties I needed nested inside the objects

    * I want the buttons to become disabled once the weight has been stored and stay disabled when you return to the page
    * the page should refresh when you clear the selected weights or the ORMs
